# KotlinState
Kotlin library designed to create a state management structure.


## Download

dependencies {
    val latestVersion = "1.0.0-alpha-04"

## Usage
KotlinState is composed by two different API's to handle user interaction. `UiState` serves as a state class for views (usually a data class), and `UiEvent` handles one shot events from a presenter to the consumer view.

# UiState
UiState is a `StateFlow<UiState<T<>` which holds a data class with 2 properties: `T` and `UiStateType`.
